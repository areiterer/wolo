# Wolo - Workout Log
Track your workout / sports activity with Wolo. All this should become is a user friendly mobile logger for
sports activity. I want to focus on the client as long as possible so it will be the client without a cloud backend most
of the time.

# Motivation
What I want to learn from this project:

* Mobile development with [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/)
* The workflow from development to deploying a finished app to the Play Store (Will focus on Android first)

# Road Map
In the first attempt there will be just a basic road map and further improvements will follow.

* [ ] Create a running Android app, where a user can
  * [ ] Log a new activity
  * [ ] See a list of previously done activities
  * [ ] Edit master data like activity types, etc.
