# Wolo - Workout Log
Track your workout / sports activity with Wolo. All this should become is a user friendly mobile logger for
sports activity. I want to focus on the client as long as possible so it will be the client without a cloud backend most
of the time.

# Motivation
What I want to learn from this project:

* Mobile development with [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/)
* UI/UX: How to build a user interface that shows every piece of information you want to see and is still easy to use 
and not cluttered.
* The workflow from development to deploying a finished app to the Play Store (Will focus on Android first)

# Road Map
In the first attempt there will be just a basic road map and further improvements will follow.

* [ ] Create a running Android app, where a user can
  * [ ] Log a new activity
  * [ ] See a list of previously done activities
  * [ ] Edit master data like activity types, etc.

# User stories
* [ ] As a user, I want to be able to log a sports activity with an amount, a unit like repetitions or distance and the 
date when I accomplished the activity.
* [ ] As a user, I want see a list of previously done activities, where i can see the type of the activity and it's quantity (amount and unit)
* [ ] As a user, I want to see a summary of all my accomplished activities,
* [ ] As a user, I want to have my activities in the workout summary aggregated for a certain year, month, week or all time.
* [ ] As a user, I want to be able to filter the workout summary for certain activities or get an overall summary
